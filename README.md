# PizzaOrderSystem
Pizza ordering system developed in Angular2.

This system was a project in my Web Technologies class which demonstrates the use of MEAN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular2, and NodeJS).

## Requirements
* Angular2+ cli
* MongoDB
* NPM (NodeJS)

## Getting started
First, clone the repo using:

```
git clone
```
then install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```
## Starting the server and client
You will need to start three terminals (run on Windows)
### Client
Go to the client folder then run

1. 
```
npm start
```
### Server
Go to the server folder then run
2.
```
node server.js
```
3.
```
mongod --dbpath data/db
```

####
Happy Ordering!
